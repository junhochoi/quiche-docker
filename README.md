# Docker Examples for quiche

Here is a collection of Dockerfile for various quiche use, as the following:

- curl/ curl + quiche for http3 client
- nginx/ nginx + quiche for http3 server
- simple/ quiche command line server and clients

Please read README.md file in each directory for instructions.

Also I pushed those images on Docker Hub so you can pull it instead of building locally:
